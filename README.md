# Vendit_v2

Converted my [Vendit](https://github.com/melmar12/Vendit) project into a Ruby on Rails app so I could add the capability to create and manage posts. The client wanted the ability to be able to post live updates in the event of a school closure for example. 

I also took advantage of SASS, some gems and other features in rails to make my old code for the site more efficient and easier to edit in the future.
